# UG-Standcars
 
Hello, I would like to share free showcar script form author https://github.com/XNORGATE/
<br>
I optimalized script to 0.0ms without using spin cars and 0.01ms using spin cars.
<br>
Only what you use is config.lua where you have all setup to your server.

Config.ShowRange = 200 -- range where cars loaded player in game
<br>
Config.LockCar = true -- true if car can be locked / false if cars cannot be locked
<br>
Config.Invisible = true -- true if car be invisible / false if cars not be invisible
<br>

Old script is 4 years without any updates, so i updated for 2024 fivem servers.
